# MUSIC-256A-FINAL
My final project for MUSIC 256A!

This program is an educational tool to teach children about chord sequences. In the game, one can select linear blocks of notes from the displayed grid and the program will determine the chord formed by these notes. The game is won by making chord sequences that make sense.

Currently, only the grid and some displayed features have been implemented. There is no ambient music or audio playback of the created chords, but there is still an interactive design with the existing elements. Also, I have decomposed and commented the program very carefully so as to reduce later work.

Created using VisualStudio2015 and openFrameworks. Created for MUSIC 256A at Stanford CCRMA.
